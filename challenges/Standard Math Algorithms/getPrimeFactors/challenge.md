# Challenge: Get Prime Factors

## Task

Your task is to create a TypeScript function called `getPrimeFactors(n: number): number[]` that will return all unique prime factors of an integer `n` in an array. A prime factor of `n` is a prime number that divides `n` without leaving a remainder. The expected complexity is \(O(n)\).

## Requirements

- The function should return unique prime factors.
- The returned prime factors should be sorted in ascending order.

## Example

```typescript
function getPrimeFactors(n: number): number[] {
  // Your implementation here
}
```

## Notes

- Ensure the function handles edge cases and large inputs efficiently.
- Write unit tests to verify the correctness of your implementation.
- Document your code for clarity.

Good luck!
