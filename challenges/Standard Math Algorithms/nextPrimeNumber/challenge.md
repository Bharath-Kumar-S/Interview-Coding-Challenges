# Next Prime Number Challenge

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer number, \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\). Your task is to write a function `nextPrime(n)`, that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the smallest prime number larger than `n`.

## Examples

- `nextPrime(7)` should return `11`, because `11` is the next prime number after `7`.
- `nextPrime(13)` should return `17`, because `17` is the next prime number after `13`.
- `nextPrime(50)` should return `53`, because `53` is the next prime number after `50`.

## Constraints

- \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\)

## Notes

- A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
- The function should efficiently find the next prime number larger than the given input `n`.
