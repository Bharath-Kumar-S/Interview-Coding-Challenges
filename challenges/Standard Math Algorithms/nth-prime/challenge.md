# N-th Prime Number

## Description

You are given a number `n`. Your task is to write a function that will return the n-th prime number. The expected complexity is O(n log n).

For example:

- If `n` is 1, the function should return 2.
- If `n` is 3, the function should return the third prime number, which is 5.
