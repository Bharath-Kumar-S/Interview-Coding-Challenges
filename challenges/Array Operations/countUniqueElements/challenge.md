# Count Unique Elements

## Problem Statement

You are given an array of `n` integers. Your task is to return the number of unique elements in the array â€” an element is unique if it appears only once in the array. You cannot use any built-in TypeScript functions to achieve this.

## Example

```typescript
countUniqueElements([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]); // returns 3
```

In the example above, there are four unique elements in the list - 1, 3, and 4.

## Constraints

- The array length `n` will be between 1 and 10^5.
- The array elements will be integers between -10^9 and 10^9.

## Function Signature

```typescript
function countUniqueElements(arr: number[]): number {
  // Your code here
}
```
