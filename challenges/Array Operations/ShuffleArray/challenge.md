You are given an array of n integers and a number k. Your task is to shuffle the array in such a way that, starting from the first element, every k-th element moves to the end of the array.

For instance, if nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and k = 3, the output should be [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 3, 6]. Here, the 3rd element 3 and the 6th element 6 (every 3rd element starting from the first) are moved to the end of the array.
