You have been given an array of n integers. Your task is to write a function that reverses the array in groups of k size, and if the last group has fewer than k elements, reverse all of them. Return the newly organized array after the groups have been reversed.

For example, given the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and k = 3, the output should be: [3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 9, 8, 7, 10]. The first three elements are reversed to get [3, 2, 1], the next three become [6, 5, 4], the following three are [9, 8, 7], and the final one remains [10] as there are fewer than k elements remaining.
