# Reverse Array Challenge

## Description

You are given an array of `n` integers. The goal of this task is to return the reversed array of integers without using any built-in TypeScript functions or methods related to reversing an array.

## Example

Input:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Output:

```
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

## Constraints

- The array will contain at least one element.
- The array will contain only integers.

## Instructions

1. Implement a function that takes an array of integers as input.
2. Reverse the array without using any built-in TypeScript functions or methods related to reversing an array.
3. Return the reversed array.

## Testing

Ensure your solution works by testing with different arrays of integers, including edge cases such as an array with a single element.

## Example Function Signature

```typescript
function reverseArray(arr: number[]): number[] {
  // Your implementation here
}
```

## Notes

- Focus on the logic to reverse the array manually.
- Avoid using `Array.prototype.reverse()` or similar methods.
- Consider edge cases and test thoroughly.
- Write clean and readable code.
- Add comments if necessary to explain your logic.
- Ensure your solution has a time complexity of O(n).

Good luck!
