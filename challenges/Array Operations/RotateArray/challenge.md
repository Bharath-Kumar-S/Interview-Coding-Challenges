Consider this TypeScript code to rotate an array by k positions. This operation might seem challenging at first, but by understanding how array indices function and utilizing TypeScript's type annotations, the process becomes more straightforward. In TypeScript, the slice() method allows us to extract parts of an array, and concat() is used for array concatenation. By using these methods together, we achieve the desired rotation. Understanding this technique can help you manipulate arrays efficiently in TypeScript.
