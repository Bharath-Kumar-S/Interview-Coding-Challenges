# Count Digits Challenge

## Task

Write a JavaScript program that takes an input string and calculates the number of digits present in that string.

## Example

If the input string is `"Hello123, JavaScript World 2023!"`, the program should output:

```
Number of digits: 7
```

## Instructions

1. Create a JavaScript function that accepts a string as an argument.
2. Iterate through the string and count the number of digit characters (`0-9`).
3. Return or print the total count of digits.

## Sample Code

```javascript
const input = "Hello123, JavaScript World 2023!";
console.log("Number of digits:", countDigits(input)); // Output: Number of digits: 7
```

## Testing

Test your function with various input strings to ensure it correctly counts the number of digits.

## Notes

- Consider edge cases such as empty strings or strings without any digits.
- Ensure your code is well-commented and follows best practices.
- You may use any JavaScript environment to run and test your code.
