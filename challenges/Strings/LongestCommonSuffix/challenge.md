You are given an array of n strings. Your task is to find the longest common suffix shared among all strings in the array. A suffix is a sequence of letters at the end of a word. For instance, in the word "flying," "ing" is a suffix.

If the given array is empty or there is no common suffix among the strings, your function should return an empty string.

For example, given an array of strings: ["barking", "parking", "starking"], the longest common suffix is "arking".

Your solution should have a time complexity of
O
(
n
∗
m
)
O(n∗m), where
n
n is the number of strings in the array and
m
m is the length of the longest string.
